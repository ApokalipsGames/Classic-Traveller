Classic Traveller Character Creator

Generates random characters for the original Traveller game developed by Mark Miller in 1977.
Character stats were defined by a six-digit Universal Personality Profile or UPP, as explained:
Strength, Dexterity, Endurance, Intelligence, Education, Social Standing
Each stat is rated from 2 to 15 (2 to F in the final form) and initial values are generated by
rolling 2x six-sided dice.

Characters are presumed to be adults, typically on their own following a military or other
professional career, with nothing better to do than explore the galaxy and look for fame and
fortune.

Professions are defined in modules, each named for the professional classes outlined in Book 1
Characters and Combat, and Supplement 4 Citizens of the Imperium. 

To add a new class, the easiest way is to copy an existing one and change the module attributes 
and functions as needed. Then, to make it work with the executor file, add lines to the code:

22. careers = ["Navy", "Marines", "Army", "Scouts", "Merchants", "Belters", "Pirates",
23.            "Hunters", "Nobles", "Barbarians", "Flyer", "NewClass"] # <--- add to end of list

and in the start() function:

78.        if att == 11:
79.            if flyer.enlistment(upp):
80.                flyer.career(name, 0, 18, 'Y', 'N', 0, upp)
81.        # copy the above code and add a new conditional, using the name you gave your module

There's probably a neater way to do all this; suggestions for improvment are always welcome.
You may copy, use, hack, modify, or kludge this software to your heart's content but please don't
sell it. You got it free, so give it to someone else who plays and loves Traveller.
